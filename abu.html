  <p>Depression is a common and serious mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in daily activities. It's more than just feeling down for a short period; it's an extended period of emotional emptiness and despair that affects how a person thinks, feels, and acts.</p>

  <p>Anxiety is a natural response to stress or danger, characterized by feelings of unease, worry, or fear. It's a normal part of life, but when these feelings become excessive, prolonged, or disproportionate to the situation, it may indicate an anxiety disorder. Symptoms can include restlessness, muscle tension, difficulty concentrating, and a heightened sense of threat. It's essential to seek support if anxiety significantly impacts daily life.</p>

  <p>Drug addiction, or substance use disorder, is a chronic condition characterized by compulsive drug seeking, continued use despite harmful consequences, and long-lasting changes in the brain. It often involves the inability to control or stop drug use, leading to significant negative effects on an individual's life. Addiction can affect various aspects, including physical health, relationships, and overall well-being. Treatment approaches typically involve a combination of therapy, counseling, and, in some cases, medication</p>
